<h2>Synopsis</h2>
 
<pre>awk [-v profiling=1] -f awklisp [optional-Lisp-source-files]</pre>
 <p>
The -v profiling=1 option turns call-count profiling on.
<p> 
If you want to use it interactively, be sure to include '-' (for the standard
input) among the source files. For example:
 <pre>gawk -f awklisp startup numbers lists -</pre>
<h2>Description</h2>    
<h3> Overview</h3>
 <p>
This program arose out of one-upmanship. At my previous job I had to
use MapBasic, an interpreter so astoundingly slow (around 100 times
slower than GWBASIC) that one must wonder if it itself is implemented
in an interpreted language. I still wonder, but it clearly could be:
a bare-bones Lisp in awk, hacked up in a few hours, ran substantially
faster. Since then I've added features and polish, in the hope of
taking over the burgeoning market for stately language
implementations.
 <p>
This version tries to deal with as many of the essential issues in
interpreter implementation as is reasonable in awk (though most would
call this program utterly unreasonable from start to finish, perhaps...).
Awk's impoverished control structures put error recovery and tail-call
optimization out of reach, in that I can't see a non-painful way to code
them. The scope of variables is dynamic because that was easier to
implement efficiently. Subject to all those constraints, the language
is as Schemely as I could make it: it has a single namespace with
uniform evaluation of expressions in the function and argument positions,
and the Scheme names for primitives and special forms.
 <p>
The rest of this file is a reference manual. My favorite tutorial would be
<em>The Little LISPer</em> (see section 5, References); don't let the cute name
and the cartoons turn you off, because it's a really excellent book with
some mind-stretching material towards the end. All of its code will work
with awklisp, except for the last two chapters. (You'd be better off
learning with a serious Lisp implementation, of course.)

<h3> Expressions and their evaluation</h3>
 <p>
Lisp evaluates expressions, which can be simple (atoms) or compound (lists).
 <p>
An atom is a string of characters, which can be letters, digits, and most
punctuation; the characters may -not- include spaces, quotes, parentheses,
brackets, '.', '#', or ';' (the comment character). In this Lisp, case is
significant ( X is different from x ).
 <ul>
<li>
Atoms: atom 42 1/137 + ok? hey:names-with-dashes-are-easy-to-read
<li>
Not atoms: don't-include-quotes (or spaces or parentheses)
</ul>
 <p>
A list is a '(', followed by zero or more objects (each of which is an atom
or a list), followed by a ')'.
 <ul>
<li>
Lists: () (a list of atoms) ((a list) of atoms (and lists))
<li>Not lists: ) ((()) (two) (lists)
</ul>
 <p>
The special object nil is both an atom and the empty list. That is,
nil = (). A non-nil list is called a -pair-, because it is represented by a
pair of pointers, one to the first element of the list (its -car-), and one to
the rest of the list (its -cdr-). For example, the car of ((a list) of stuff)
is (a list), and the cdr is (of stuff). It's also possible to have a pair
whose cdr is not a list; the pair with car A and cdr B is printed as (A . B).
 <p>
That's the syntax of programs and data. Now let's consider their meaning. You
can use Lisp like a calculator: type in an expression, and Lisp prints its
value. If you type 25, it prints 25. If you type (+ 2 2), it prints 4. In
general, Lisp evaluates a particular expression in a particular environment
(set of variable bindings) by following this algorithm:
 <ul>
<li>
If the expression is a number, return that number.
 <li>
If the expression is a non-numeric atom (a -symbol-), return the value of that
symbol in the current environment. If the symbol is currently unbound, that's
an error.
 <li>
Otherwise the expression is a list. If its car is one of the symbols: quote,
lambda, if, begin, while, set!, or define, then the expression is a -special-
-form-, handled by special rules. Otherwise it's just a procedure call,
handled like this: evaluate each element of the list in the current environment,
and then apply the operator (the value of the car) to the operands (the values
of the rest of the list's elements). For example, to evaluate (+ 2 3), we
first evaluate each of its subexpressions: the value of + is (at least in the
initial environment) the primitive procedure that adds, the value of 2 is 2,
and the value of 3 is 3. Then we call the addition procedure with 2 and 3 as
arguments, yielding 5. For another example, take (- (+ 2 3) 1). Evaluating
each subexpression gives the subtraction procedure, 5, and 1. Applying the
procedure to the arguments gives 4.
 </ul>
We'll see all the primitive procedures in the next section. A user-defined
procedure is represented as a list of the form (lambda &lt;parameters> &lt;body>),
such as (lambda (x) (+ x 1)). To apply such a procedure, evaluate its body
in the environment obtained by extending the current environment so that the
parameters are bound to the corresponding arguments. Thus, to apply the above
procedure to the argument 41, evaluate (+ x 1) in the same environment as the
current one except that x is bound to 41.
 <p>
If the procedure's body has more than one expression -- e.g.,
(lambda () (write 'Hello) (write 'world!)) -- evaluate them each in turn, and
return the value of the last one.
 <p>
We still need the rules for special forms. They are:
 <ul>
<li>
The value of (quote &lt;x>) is &lt;x>. There's a shorthand for this form: '<x>.
E.g., the value of '(+ 2 2) is (+ 2 2), -not- 4.
 <li>
(lambda &lt;parameters> <body>) returns itself: e.g., the value of (lambda (x) x)
is (lambda (x) x).
 <li>
To evaluate (if &lt;test-expr> &lt;then-exp> &lt;else-exp>), first evaluate &lt;test-expr>.
If the value is true (non-nil), then return the value of &lt;then-exp>, otherwise
return the value of &lt;else-exp>. (&lt;else-exp> is optional; if it's left out,
pretend there's a nil there.) Example: (if nil 'yes 'no) returns no.
 <li>
To evaluate (begin &lt;expr-1> &lt;expr-2>...), evaluate each of the subexpressions
in order, returning the value of the last one.
 <li>
To evaluate (while &lt;test> &lt;expr-1> &lt;expr-2>...), first evaluate &lt;test>. If
it's nil, return nil. Otherwise, evaluate &lt;expr-1>, &lt;expr-2>,... in order,
and then repeat.
 <li>
To evaluate (set! &lt;variable> &lt;expr>), evaluate &lt;expr>, and then set the value
of &lt;variable> in the current environment to the result. If the variable is
currently unbound, that's an error. The value of the whole set! expression
is the value of &lt;expr>.
 <li>
(define &lt;variable> &lt;expr>) is like set!, except it's used to introduce new
bindings, and the value returned is &lt;variable>.
 </ul>
<p>It's possible to define new special forms using the macro facility provided in
the startup file. The macros defined there are:
<ul>
<li><pre>
(let ((&lt;var> &lt;expr>)...)
  &lt;body>...)</pre>
  Bind each &lt;var> to its corresponding &lt;expr> (evaluated in the current
  environment), and evaluate &lt;body> in the resulting environment.
<li> 
<pre>(cond (&lt;test-expr> &lt;result-expr>...)... (else &lt;result-expr>...))</pre>
  
  where the final else clause is optional. Evaluate each &lt;test-expr> in
  turn, and for the first non-nil result, evaluate its &lt;result-expr>. If
  none are non-nil, and there's no else clause, return nil.
 
<li><pre>(and &lt;expr>...)</pre>
 
  Evaluate each &lt;expr> in order, until one returns nil; then return nil.
  If none are nil, return the value of the last &lt;expr>.
 
<li><pre>(or &lt;expr>...)</pre>
 
  Evaluate each &lt;expr> in order, until one returns non-nil; return that value.
  If all are nil, return nil.
 </ul>

<h3>Implementation Notes</h3>
 
<h4> Overview</h4>
 
<p>
Since the code should be self-explanatory to anyone knowledgeable
about Lisp implementation, these notes assume you know Lisp but not
interpreters. I haven't got around to writing up a complete
discussion of everything, though.
 <p>
The code for an interpreter can be pretty low on redundancy -- this is
natural because the whole reason for implementing a new language is to
avoid having to code a particular class of programs in a redundant
style in the old language. We implement what that class of programs
has in common just once, then use it many times. Thus an interpreter
has a different style of code, perhaps denser, than a typical
application program.
 
 
<h4> Data representation</h4>
<p>
Conceptually, a Lisp datum is a tagged pointer, with the tag giving
the datatype and the pointer locating the data. We follow the common
practice of encoding the tag into the two lowest-order bits of the
pointer. This is especially easy in awk, since arrays with
non-consecutive indices are just as efficient as dense ones (so we can
use the tagged pointer directly as an index, without having to mask
out the tag bits). (But, by the way, mawk accesses negative indices
much more slowly than positive ones, as I found out when trying a
different encoding.)
 <p>
This Lisp provides three datatypes: integers, lists, and symbols. (A
modern Lisp provides many more.)
 <p>
For an integer, the tag bits are zero and the pointer bits are simply
the numeric value; thus, N is represented by N*4. This choice of the
tag value has two advantages. First, we can add and subtract without
fiddling with the tags. Second, negative numbers fit right in.
(Consider what would happen if N were represented by 1+N*4 instead,
and we tried to extract the tag as N%4, where N may be either positive
or negative. Because of this problem and the above-mentioned
inefficiency of negative indices, all other datatypes are represented
by positive numbers.)
 
 
<h4>The evaluation/saved-bindings stack</h4>
 <p>
The following is from an email discussion; it doesn't develop
everything from first principles but is included here in the hope
it will be helpful.
 <p>
Hi. I just took a look at awklisp, and remembered that there's more
to your question about why we need a stack -- it's a good question.
The real reason is because a stack is accessible to the garbage
collector.
 <p>
We could have had apply() evaluate the arguments itself, and stash
the results into variables like arg0 and arg1 -- then the case for
ADD would look like
<pre>
if (proc == ADD) return is(a_number, arg0) + is(a_number, arg1)
</pre>
<p>The obvious problem with that approach is how to handle calls to
user-defined procedures, which could have any number of arguments.
Say we're evaluating ((lambda (x) (+ x 1)) 42). (lambda (x) (+ x 1))
is the procedure, and 42 is the argument.
 <p>
A (wrong) solution could be to evaluate each argument in turn, and
bind the corresponding parameter name (like x in this case) to the
resulting value (while saving the old value to be restored after we
return from the procedure). This is wrong because we must not
change the variable bindings until we actually enter the procedure --
for example, with that algorithm ((lambda (x y) y) 1 x) would return
1, when it should return whatever the value of x is in the enclosing
environment. (The eval_rands()-type sequence would be: eval the 1,
bind x to 1, eval the x -- yielding 1 which is *wrong* -- and bind
y to that, then eval the body of the lambda.)
 <p>
Okay, that's easily fixed -- evaluate all the operands and stash them
away somewhere until you're done, and *then* do the bindings. So
the question is where to stash them. How about a global array?
Like
<pre>for (i = 0; arglist != NIL; ++i) {
    global_temp[i] = eval(car[arglist])
    arglist = cdr[arglist]
}</pre>
<p>followed by the equivalent of extend_env(). This will not do, because
the global array will get clobbered in recursive calls to eval().
Consider (+ 2 (* 3 4)) -- first we evaluate the arguments to the +,
like this: global_temp[0] gets 2, and then global_temp[1] gets the
eval of (* 3 4). But in evaluating (* 3 4), global_temp[0] gets set
to 3 and global_temp[1] to 4 -- so the original assignment of 2 to
global_temp[0] is clobbered before we get a chance to use it. By
using a stack[] instead of a global_temp[], we finesse this problem.
 <p>
You may object that we can solve that by just making the global array
local, and that's true; lots of small local arrays may or may not be
more efficient than one big global stack, in awk -- we'd have to try
it out to see. But the real problem I alluded to at the start of this
message is this: the garbage collector has to be able to find all the
live references to the car[] and cdr[] arrays. If some of those
references are hidden away in local variables of recursive procedures,
we're stuck. With the global stack, they're all right there for the
gc().
 <p>
(In C we could use the local-arrays approach by threading a chain of
pointers from each one to the next; but awk doesn't have pointers.)
 <p>
(You may wonder how the code gets away with having a number of local
variables holding lisp values, then -- the answer is that in every
such case we can be sure the garbage collector can find the values
in question from some other source. That's what this comment is
about:
 <pre>
  # All the interpretation routines have the precondition that their
  # arguments are protected from garbage collection.
</pre>
<p>In some cases where the values would not otherwise be guaranteed to
be available to the gc, we call protect().)
<p> 
Oh, there's another reason why apply() doesn't evaluate the arguments
itself: it's called by do_apply(), which handles lisp calls like
(apply car '((x))) -- where we *don't* want the x to get evaluated
by apply().

<h2> Bugs</h2>
 <p>
Eval doesn't check the syntax of expressions. This is a probably-misguided
attempt to bump up the speed a bit, that also simplifies some of the code.
The macroexpander in the startup file would be the best place to add syntax-
checking.
