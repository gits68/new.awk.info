<h1><join>Text Mining</join></h1>
<p>Some of the code at awk.info is somewhat historical in nature. For example, Scott Pakin's <a href="http://awk.info/?gender">gender
predictor</a> was written in 1991. Given that, it might be mistakenly concluded that Awk is somehow old-fashioned and not suitable
for modern tasks.
<p>Text mining, on the other hand, could be the killer app for Awk in the 21st century. 
The language excels at creating one-off reports that handle the quirks
of a particular file format. 
<p>
There is a growing interest in using Awk for this kind of work.
All the examples presented below come from work conducted in 2007, 2008:
<h2>Why Text Mining?</h2>
<p>If we could properly understand unstructured text, this would 
be a result of tremendous practical importance. A <a href="http://www.b-eye-network.com/view/2098">recent study</a>
concluded that: 
<ul>
<li> 80 percent of business is conducted on unstructured information; 
<li>
85 percent of all data stored is held in an unstructured 
format;
<li>
Unstructured data doubles every three months; 
</ul>
<p>That is, if we can tame the text mining problem, it would 
be possible to reason and learn from a much wider range of 
business  data than ever before. 
<h2>Results (with Awk)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Menzies and Marcus  <a href="?textmine/severis">prototyped a set of scripts to text mine NASA issue reports</a>.
<li> 
Lothar M. Schmitt and Kiel T. Christianson discuss a more general tool kit in 
<a href="?textmine/languageAnalysis">
Combining the Bourne-shell, sed and awk in the UNIX 
environment for language analysis</a> 
<li>
Further, despite its maturity (polite way of saying "written a very long time ago"),
Awk still runs as fast (or faster) than supposedly more modern languages (perhaps because it its simple- fewer layers between the data
and the processing). Donald McCarthy's <a href="http://awk.info/?doc/textmine/textmunge.html">comparative analysis</a>
show that Awk is not necessarily slower
than certain other script-based text miners.
</ul>
<p>
Note that, in the Menzies/Marcus and Schmitt/Christianson tool kits,
Awk by itself was not enough. The two data mining toolkits mentioned
above were all intricate combinations of Awk and sed and bash and etc
end etc.  Within that combination, Awk was very useful for handling
the specifics not managed by the other tools.
