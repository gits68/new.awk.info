<h1><join>The Monty Hall Problem</join></h1>
<p><a href="mailto:paddy3118@googlemail.com">Donald 'Paddy' McCarthy</a>
has a nice Awk solution to the Monty Hall Problem, which he describes as follow:
<ul>
    <li> The contestant in in front of three  doors that he cannot see behind.. 
    <li> The three doors conceal one prize and the rest being booby prizes, arranged randomly.
    <li> The Host asks the contestant to choose a door.
    <li> The host then goes behind the doors where only he can see what is concealed, then always opens one door, out of the other s not chosen  by the contestant, that must reveal a booby prize to the contestant.
    <li> The host then asks the contestant if he would like either to stick with his previous choice, or switch and choose the other remaining closed door.
</ul>
<p>
It turns out that if the contestant follows a strategy of always switching when asked, then he will maximise his chances of winning.
Donald's simulator shows that:
<ul>
<li>
     A strategy of never switching wins 1/3rd of the time.
    <li> A strategy of randomly switching wins 1/2 of the time.
    <li> A strategy of always switching wins 2/3rds of the time.
</ul>

<h2>Sample Output</h2>
<pre>
gawk -f montyHall.awk

Monty Hall problem simulation:
3 doors, 10000 iterations.

  Algorithm    keep: prize count = 3411, =  34.11%
  Algorithm  switch: prize count = 6655, =  66.55%
  Algorithm  random: prize count = 4991, =  49.91%
