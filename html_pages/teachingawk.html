Whenever Ronald Loui teaches GAWK, he gives the students the choice of learning PERL instead. Ninety percent will choose GAWK after looking at a few simple examples of each language (samples shown below). Those who choose PERL do so because someone told them to learn PERL.
<p>
After one laboratory, more than half of the GAWK students are confident with their GAWK skills and can begin designing. Almost no student can become confident in PERL that quickly.
<p>
After a week, 90% of those who have attempted GAWK have mastered it, compared to fewer than 50% of PERL students attaining similar facility with the language (it would be unfair to require one to `master' PERL).
<p>
By the end of the semester, over 90% who have attempted GAWK have succeeded, and about two-thirds of those who have attempted PERL have succeeded.
<p>
To be fair, within a year, half of the GAWK programmers have also studied PERL. Most are doing so in order to read PERL and will not switch to writing PERL. No one who learns PERL migrates to GAWK.
<p>
PERL and GAWK appear to have similar programming, development, and debugging cycle times.
<p>
Finally, there seems to be a small advantage for GAWK over PERL, after a year, for the programmers willingness to begin a new program. That is, both GAWK and PERL programmers tend to enjoy writing a lot of programs, but GAWK has the slight edge here.
