<h2> Description </h2><p>
<p>
Awk++ is a 'preprocessor', in the sense that it reads in a program written in the awk++ language and outputs a new program. It can be used as a run time interpreter, ala 'igawk', by running the included shell script or BAT file. However, it's different than 'awka'. The output from the awk++ preprocessor is awk code, not C or an executable program. So, some version of AWK, such as awk or gawk, has to be used to run the 'preprocessed' program. 'awka' can be used, in a second step, to turn the preprocessed awk++ program into an executable, if desired. 

<h2> Awk </h2><p>

<P>Gawk for the pre-processing; any awk for the subsequent execution.
