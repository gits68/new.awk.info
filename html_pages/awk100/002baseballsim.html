<p>This is a <a href="http://awk.info/?awk100">Awk 100</a> program.
<h2>Purpose</h2><p> A quick and dirty baseball simulator for investigating the efficiency of batting lineups

<h2>Description</h2><p> This was written for the AI course, and for several investigations, including the determination of whether it is a good idea to bat the pitcher in the 8th spot.  One hypothesis that emerges from this program that deserves further study is that the most potent offense is one that spreads rather than concentrates the batting threats. 
<h2>Awk</h2><p> Gawk around 2002 
<h2>Platform</h2><p> Linux around 2002 
<h2>Uses</h2><p> None 
<h2>Lines</h2><p> 409 
<h2>DevelopmentEffort</h2><p> Approximately one day 
<h2>MaintenanceEffort</h2><p> Further simulators were developed for improved domain modeling and for successive addition of functionality; no other code maintenance was required.  
<h2>CurrentStatus</h2><p> 1=Prototype 
<h2>Use</h2><p> 1=Personal use 
<h2>Users</h2><p> About 50 students used this program over three years in AI classes, and two undergraduate theses and one Master's thesis on evolutionary computing made use of this simulator.
