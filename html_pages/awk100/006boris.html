<h2> Domain </h2>
<p>
This is an evolutionary algorithm and visualization of a clustering
algorithm that could be turned from O(n^4) to O(nlogn) with a few
judicious uses of constants.  Later developments added other
interactive devices, including progress meters and mouse-and-click
behavior.

<h2> Description </h2><p>

The code is an excellent example of the power of Awk as a prototyping
tool: after getting the code running, with the least development time,
a quirk was observed in the code that allowed a reduction from O(n^4)
to O(nlogn).

<ul>
<li>
 Two of the n's are lost
(n^2) by noticing that when there is a swap, the delta in the scoring
function falls off by the squared distance from the point of a swap.
So if you just set a constant, such as 10 or 20, or 100, based on the
expected size of your clusters, then you can stop calculating the
scoring function when you get past that constant. 
<li>
 The other n comes
from either fixing the size of the matrix, and occasionally flushing
new candidates in and out, or else by sampling over a subset of the n
when you calculate the score.  
<li> The nlogn remains
because there is a sort every now and then. 
</ul>
