<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Severis is a set of Awk, bash, sed, etc scripts for finding predictors of high severity issues in text reports.
Test engineers write such issue reports whenever they encounter anomalies in the code they are inspecting.
<p>Severis was designed to be an audit tool for test engineers, a second "look over the shoulder" to alert 
a senior engineer if a junior test engineer was doing something strange.
<p>At least for the text issue reports studied by Severis, very simple tools were enough to determine the 
terms that predicting for different issue severities.
