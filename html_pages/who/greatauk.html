<p>Some must lead, some must follow, and some have to fix the typos.
<p>A <em>Great Auk</em>  is someone with write permission to 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/lawker/source/browse/">our repository</a>. Since the source for this web
site is stored in that repoistory, it also means that they are
webmasters of this site. So they (try) to:
<ol>
<li>
 keep the code and pages in a (somewhat) consistent form, 
<li>encourage code
documentation and test suites, 
<li>watch comp.lang.awk for cool stuff to add to this site, 
<li>write little demo programs, 
<li>handle
queries about this site, 
<li>work the issue reports, 
<li>etc.
</ol>

<p>If you want to be a  Great Auk, please start <a href="http://awk.info/?contribute">contributing to this site using any of the usual methods</a>. Once it is clear that you
know what you are doing and that you
play nice with others, then you should ask a current Great Auk to nominate you. Then, all the current Great Auks will vote about giving
your write access.
<p>The current Great Auks are
<ul>
<li><a href="http://awk.info/?who/jhart">Jim Hart</a>
<li><a href="http://awk.info/?who/timm">Tim Menzies</a>
</ul>
