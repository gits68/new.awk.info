**Abstract**

The current several classes of intrusion alert have various
formats and semantics. And it is transferred using a variety of
protocols. The protocols that transfer intrusion alert are IDXP,
SNMP trap, SYSLOG protocol, etc. These varieties of intrusion
alert formats make it difticult to use that together. Intrusion alert
normalization makes various intrusion alert to same structure
data and same semantics. We need this normalition process to
unify alerts from a variety of security equipments. This paper 
describes how to normalize alerts from several IDS and security
equipments.
