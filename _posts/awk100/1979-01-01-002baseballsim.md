## Description

This was written for the AI course, and for several investigations,
including the determination of whether it is a good idea to bat the
pitcher in the 8th spot.  One hypothesis that emerges from this program
that deserves further study is that the most potent offense is one that
spreads rather than concentrates the batting threats.
