## Description

Awk++ is a 'preprocessor', in the sense that it reads in a program
written in the awk++ language and outputs a new program. It can be used
as a run time interpreter, ala 'igawk', by running the included shell
script or BAT file. However, it's different than 'awka'. The output from
the awk++ preprocessor is awk code, not C or an executable program. So,
some version of AWK, such as awk or gawk, has to be used to run the
'preprocessed' program. 'awka' can be used, in a second step, to turn
the preprocessed awk++ program into an executable, if desired.

## Awk

Gawk for the pre-processing; any awk for the subsequent execution.
