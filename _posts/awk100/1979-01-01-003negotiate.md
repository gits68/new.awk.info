An **(TODO: Change link)** [Awk100][1] program.

## Purpose

Research on a model of negotiation incorporating search, dialogue,
and changing expectations

## Source code

See [gawk/awk100/negotiate][2].

## Developers

Ronald Loui (programmer and designer), Anne Jump (adversary)

## Organization

National Science Foundation grant at Washington University in St. Louis

## Country

USA 

## Domain

Prototype of a new idea for cognitive modelling (in artificial
intelligence/economics/organizational behavior)

## Description

Program generates a game board upon which players take turn searching
or declaring according to a protocol.  It is based on the same game
bimatrix made famous by people like von Neumann and Nash, but invents
a new approach to negotiation based on process instead of solution.

## Awk

Was written for gawk in 1997 but should run on almost any awk dialect

## Platform

Was written on Redhat Linux with multiple hardware platforms in mind

## Uses

Was intended to be self-contained 

## Lines

658 lines, of which 39 are comments 

## DevelopmentEffort

One day, 6-8 hours total 

## MaintenanceEffort

Two revisions are available, mainly to permit programs to negotiate
instead of humans, and to provide a web-based dashboard to monitor
the events

## CurrentStatus

2=Evaluation 

## Use

2=in-House use 

## Users

50 students in artificial intelligence project classes had to use some
version of this code over three yeears

## DateDeployed

October 1997 

## Dated

January 2008
