# Soccer

## Purpose

AI Programming lab class challenge.

## Installation

Download from [LAWKER][1]. Look at the first line of each file for
something that looks like this:

{% highlight sh %}
#!/usr/bin/gawk -f
{% endhighlight %}

Replace this with the full path to the local version of Gawk.

## Developers

## Organization

Washington University in St. Louis 

## Country

USA

## Domain

Text-based game simulation.

## Description

*Ronald Loui writes*: Most people are surprised when I tell them what
language we use in our undergraduate AI programming class. That's
understandable. We use GAWK. GAWK, Gnu's version of Aho, Weinberger,
and Kernighan's old pattern scanning language

![Soccer][2]

This code manages a CGI interface to a process that simulates a soccer
game, polling for inputs from two student programs.

A repeated observation in this class is that only the scripting
programmers can generate code fast enough to keep up with the demands
of the class. Even though students were allowed to choose any language
they wanted, and many had to unlearn the java ways of doing things in
order to benefit from scripting, there were few who could develop ideas
into code effectively and rapidly without scripting.

In the puny language, GAWK, which Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan thought
not much more important than grep or sed, **(TODO: Change link)** [I find
lessons in AI's trends, Airs history, and the foundations of AI][3].
What I have found not only surprising but also hopeful, is that when I
have approached the AI people who still enjoy programming, some of them
are not the least bit surprised.

## Awk

Was written for gawk in 1995 but should run on almost any awk dialect;
some CSS positioning commands will not work in all browsers; try IE6.

## Platform

Was written on Redhat Linux with multiple hardware platforms in mind.

## Uses

Intended to be run on close server to minimize delays.

## Lines

605 lines in main cgi with several small aux control programs.

## DevelopmentEffort

Minimal compared to development effort, but potentially will require
CSS for new browsers.

## MaintenanceEffort

Number of person-months since, including enhancements

## Current

2=Evaluation.

## Users

50 students in artificial intelligence project classes had to use some
version of this code over seven years

## DateDeployed

October 2004

## Dated

April 2009
