## Description

At my previous job I had to use MapBasic, an interpreter so astoundingly
slow (around 100 times slower than GWBASIC) that one must wonder if it
itself is implemented in an interpreted language. I still wonder, but
it clearly could be: a bare-bones Lisp in awk, hacked up in a few hours,
ran substantially faster.
