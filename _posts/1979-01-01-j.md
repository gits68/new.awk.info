Awk's Equivalent to VI's J
==========================

A [recent discussion][post] in [comp.lang.awk][clawk] demonstrated a
very cute, and very succint, awk trick.

Neil Harris wanted to clean up this output:

    host1name.com 
    10.10.10.1 
    host2name.com 
    10.10.10.2 
    host3name.com 
    10.10.10.3 

He was using an uppercase J in vi to manually move the hostname's
IP address up onto the same line as it's hostname. But he wanted to
automate the task with awk.

Kenny McCormack offered:

{% highlight awk %}
ORS=NR%2?" ":"\n" 
{% endhighlight %}

(Yes, that is the whole program.)

Ed Morton offered a more elegant version:

{% highlight awk %}
ORS=NR%2?FS:RS 
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, Kenny McCormack commented:

+ _I'm 98% sure that I personally invented the basic idea (ORS=... as
  the pattern, with no action - i.e., default action)._
+ _Ed's enhancement was using FS and RS instead of hardcoding space
  and newline.  It's nice for two reasons:_
  1. _Saves a few golf strokes_
  2. _Is more "portable" (or "logical", if you look at it that way)
     in that if FS and RS had been assigned non-default values, they
     would be used._
+ _Also, as he says, it is a very instructive 14 characters of AWK code._
