## 99 Bottles of Beer

You know the song:

>99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
>
>Take one down and pass it around, 98 bottles of beer on the wall.
>
>98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer.
>
>Take one down and pass it around, 97 bottles of beer on the wall.
>
>97 bottles of beer on the wall, 97 bottles of beer.
>
>Take one down and pass it around, 96 bottles of beer on the wall.
>
>....

But how do you code it?

#### Bottled version ([download]({{site.baseurl}}/lib/awk/99_bottles_weske.awk))

Here's [Wilhelm Weske](http://www.faert.de)'s version.

It is kind of fun but its a little hard to read:

{% highlight awk %}
{% insert_example lib/awk/99_bottles_weske.awk %}
{% endhighlight %}



#### C-Like version ([download]({{site.baseurl}}/lib/awk/99_bottles_osamu.awk))

[Osamu Aoki](http://people.debian.org/~osamu) has a more maintainable version.
Note how all the screen I/O is localized via functions that return strings,
rather than printing straight to the screen.
This is *very* useful for maintaince purposes or including code as libraries
into other Awk programs.

{% highlight awk %}
{% insert_example lib/awk/99_bottles_osamu.awk %}
{% endhighlight %}




#### AWK-ish version ([download]({{site.baseurl}}/lib/awk/99_bottles_robbins.awk))


Osamu's version is very similar to how it'd be done in C or other languages and
it does not  take full advantage of Awk's features.
So Arnold Robbins wrote  a third  version that is more data driven.
Most of the work is done in a pre-processor and the actual runtime just dumps
text decided before the run. This solution might take more time (to do the
setup) but it does allow for the simple switching of the interface
(just change the last 10 lines).

{% highlight awk %}
{% insert_example lib/awk/99_bottles_robbins.awk %}
{% endhighlight %}

I'll drink to that.
