## Description

Sorts a Unix style mailbox by "thread", in date+subject order.
This is a  script I use quite a lot.  It requires gawk although with some work could
be ported to standard awk.  The timezone offset from GMT has to be
adjust to one's local offset, although I could probably eliminate
that if I wanted to work on it hard enough.
This took me a while to write and get right, but it's been working
flawlessly for a few years now.
The script uses Message-ID header to detect and remove duplicates.  It requires GNU Awk for
time/date functions and for efficiency hack in string concatenation but could
be made to run on a POSIX awk with some work.
