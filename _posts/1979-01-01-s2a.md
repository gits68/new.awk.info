## s2a: sed to Awk

#### Download

[sed2awk.awk]({{site.baseurl}}/lib/awk/sed2awk.awk)

#### Description

The s2a project is a sed to awk conversion utility written in awk.
As input it takes sed scripts, and it outputs an equivalent awk script.

This version should be fully functional as far as the following sed
commands are concerned: `a,d,s,p,q,c,i,n`.

Commands to be implemented in the future: `{},=,h,g,N,P,r,x,y,l,H,G,D,b,t,:`

#### Bugs

`$` is not a valid line address.
Also, line continuation with `\` is not implemented.
