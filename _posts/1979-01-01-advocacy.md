Awk Advocacy
============

_"Because easy is not wrong."_ - Anon

From various sources:

- [Why Awk?][source01]
- [Teaching Awk][source02]
- [Awk and AI][source03]

Quotes:

- "Listen to people who program, not to people who want to tell you how to program."  
  \- [Ronald P. Loui][rploui]
- "Good design is as little design as possible."  
  \- [Dieter Rams][drams]
- "When we have on occasion rewritten an Awk program in a conventional
  programming language like C or C++, the result was usually much longer,
  and much harder to debug."  
  \- Arnold Robbins & Nelson Beebe

From [Project Management Advice][source04]:

- More programming theory does not make better programmers.
- Don\`t let old/compiler people tell you what language to use.
- If there is already a way of doing something, do not invent a harder way.

From [Awk programming][source05]:

- Awk is a simple and elegant pattern scanning and processing language.
- Awk is also the most portable scripting language in existence.
- But why use it rather than Perl (or PHP or Ruby or...):
  - Awk is simpler (especially important if deciding which to learn
    first);
  - Awk syntax is far more regular (another advantage for the beginner,
    even without considering syntax-highlighting editors);
  - You may already know Awk well enough for the task at hand;
  - You may have only Awk installed;
  - Awk can be smaller, thus much quicker to execute for small programs.

From [Awk as a Major Systems Programming Language][source06]:

- Effective use of its data structures and its stream-oriented structure
  takes some adjustment for C programmers, but the results can be quite
  striking.

According to [Ramesh Natarajan][source07]:

- AWK is a superb language for testing algorithms and applications
  with some complexity, especially where the problem can be broken into
  chunks which can be streamed as part of a pipe. It\`s an ideal tool
  for augmenting the features of shell programming as it is ubiquitous;
  found in some form on almost all Unix/Linux/BSD systems. Many problems
  dealing with text, log lines or symbol tables are handily solved or
  at the very least prototyped with awk along with the other tools found
  on Unix/Linux systems.

From the [NoSQL pages][source08]:

- (Other languages like Perl is) a good programming language for writing
  self-contained programs, but pre-compilation and long start-up time are
  worth paying only if once the program has loaded it can do everything
  in one go. This contrasts sharply with the Operator-stream Paradigm,
  where operators are chained together in pipelines of two, three or
  more programs. The overhead associated with initializing (say) Perl at
  every stage of the pipeline makes pipelining inefficient. A better way
  of manipulating structured ASCII files is to use the AWK programming
  language, which is much smaller, more specialized for this task,
  and is very fast at startup.
