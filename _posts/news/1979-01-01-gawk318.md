Gawk 3.1.8: ready (nearly)
==========================

OK folks, after much more work than I expected (and it's *always* much
more work than I expect), I'm announcing a public very-late-beta of what
will become gawk 3.1.8:

+ **(TODO: Dead link)** <http://www.skeeve.com/gawk/gawk-3.1.7i.tar.gz>

Of major note is that the dfa matcher is very closely in sync with
what's in the GNU grep git tree; there are a number of improvements
in it and we can hope that regex matching in multibyte locales is now
faster than before.

Try this out, and let me know if you find something that doesn't work.

PLEASE just [email me][1] directly; relying on the newsgroup is not
the best course.

Thanks,  
-- Arnold
