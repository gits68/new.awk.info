Awk.info Gaining Popularity
===========================

_Nov 28, 2009_

This site is moving up the page rankings:

+ Four months ago, typing "awk" into Google resulted in pages of output
  where the first mention of awk.info did not appear till half-way down
  page five.
+ Today, the same query finds "awk.info" on page two (in position 18).

Other indicators also look good. Since the site was launched (Feb 15,
2009), the number of visits has been steadily increasing:

These 19,268 visits come from 2,765 cities:

Apart from Granville West Virginia (where this site is administrated),
the three cities with the most  visits are:

+ London, England: 389 visits;
+ Thessaloniki, Greece: 491 visits;  
+ Athens, Greece: 640 visits. 

(BTW: Anyone got any ideas why these cities visit here so often?)

In other news, [Website Outlook][1] reports that:

+ This site is now worth $1423.5 USD.
+ And the daily ad revenue stream from awk.info would be $1.95.

To put that report in perspective, the same source notes that:

+ [rottentomatoes.com][2] is worth $3,300,000.
+ And the daily revenue stream from that site would be $4523.19.
