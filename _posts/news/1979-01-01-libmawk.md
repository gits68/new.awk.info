How to Call Awk from "C" with Libmawk
=====================================

Libmawk is a fork of mawk 1.3.3 restructured for embedding. This means the
user gets libmawk.h and libmawk.so and can embed awk scripting language
in any application written in C.

The project can be downloaded [here][1].

Features
--------

Libmawk has the following main features:

+ load and run multiple awk scripts independently, in parallel
+ scripts do not read stdin but a memory buffer the embedding process
  can fill from time to time
+ running scripts in (mostly) non-blocking manner - that is, the script
  will not block if the process can not provide new input
+ all these without threads or fork()
+ call awk functions from C, using vararg for smooth integration
+ call C functions from awk scripts
+ resolve existing awk variables from C - read or write variables


License
-------

Since mawk is licensed under the GNU GPL v2 and libmawk is a fork of mawk,
libmawk is licensed under the GNU GPL v2 too.
