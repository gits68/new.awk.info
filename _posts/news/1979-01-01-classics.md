Classic Awk Papers
==================

Brian Kernighan has posted two classic Awk papers to awk.info:

+ The first is a reconstituted version of the "Software: Practice and
  Experience" paper on Awk published in 1979.
+ The second is a scan of CSTR 118 from 1986 or so that is the first
  description of "new" awk.
