Errata: WHINY_USERS slows down Awk
==================================

On Nov 30'09, Hermann Peifer found and fixed bug in an older
version of the test code at the end of **(TODO: Change link)**
<http://awk.info/?tip/whinyUsers>.

With the older, incorrect, version it was reported that keeping all Awk
arrays sorted had very little impact on performance.

With Hermann's fix, we can now show that sorting slows down processing by 
15% (at least, for the example explored on that page.)

Thanks to Hermann for that correction.
