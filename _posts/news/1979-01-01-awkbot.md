AWKBOT
======
 
URL: <http://www.blisted.org/wiki/projects/awkbot>

Awkbot is a  small bot written in 100% GNU Awk, awkbot requires GNU Awk
version 3.1.1.

Awkbot Has ability to search google, search the awk man page for
descriptions of functions and built in variables.

The tool accepts a simple configuration file, and has a small wrapper
written in sh for automatic restarts.

The goal of the tool is to (eventually) become a clone of info bot with
awk adaptations to prove to those fools in #perl on freenode that awk
really is a programming language

AWKBot uses **(TODO: Change link)** [mysql.awk][1] to connect to, and
query, a MySQL database where it will store information you give it, and
recall it later. It also uses this to track karma points, and maybe more
in the future. It similarly uses some interesting pipelining to do IPC,
to support awkpaste
