Spawk for SUSE Linux
====================

I've just installed the openSUSE Milestone 8 (11.2) in a virtual machine
in my PC.

In about half an hour, I've also downloaded MySQL, gawk sources and
SPAWK (SQL + AWK) sources, compiled and build the SPAWK  libraries
(/usr/lib/libspawk.so and /usr/lib/libspawk_r.so).

I've tested the module and worked just fine, so I've
uploaded the binary tarball for this distro in SPAWK project
(<http://code.google.com/p/spawk/downloads/list>).

Have a Happy New Year!
