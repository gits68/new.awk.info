*I just started with awk and sed, I am more of a perl/C/C++ person.
I have a quick question reguarding the pipe. In Awk, I am trying to use
this construct.*

{% highlight awk %}
while ((getline < "somedata.txt") > 0)
            {print | "mv"} #or could be "mv -v" for verbose. 
{% endhighlight %}

*Is it possible that "print" is no longer printing the value of getline,
if so how do I correct it?*

*Arnold Robbins* comments:

The problem here is that `mv` doesn't read standard input, it only
processes command lines.  Assuming that your data is something like:

	oldfile newfile

You can do things two ways:

{% highlight awk %}
# build the command and execute it
while ((getline &lt; "somedata.txt") > 0) {
          command = "mv " $1 " " $2
          system(command)
}
close("somedata.txt")
{% endhighlight %}

or this way:

{% highlight awk %}
# send commands to the shell
while ((getline &lt; "somedata.txt") > 0) {
          printf("mv %s %s\n", $1, $2) | "sh"
}
close("somedata.txt")
close("sh")
{% endhighlight %}

The latter is more efficient.
